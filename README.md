# InstructionGuideForAwsDeepracerChallenge

This repository was made as Udacity gave very less information on setting up the work environment. 
This Repo will contain all the details with screenshots to list all what is required to do when you are signing up for aws and udacity for the first time. 

## How does it work?

1. A user creates a Udacity account and enrolls for the deepRacer challenge.
2. He/She also creates an aws Starter Account to virtually simulate the training process.
3. He/She aliases that aws account with Udacity so that Udacity knows where to find that user.

    Tip: As per the udacity orientation video, they mentioned that they are working on a separate leaderBoard for the users that have applied for Udacity Deepracer challenge. But right now, your best time goes in the global LeaderBoard

### Prerequisites

1. For AWS Starter Account:
    1. Must have a debit/credit card with recurring payments.

2. For Udacity
    1. Nothing specific is required.



### Setting Up a AWS Starter Account

1. Go to this url : https://aws.amazon.com
2. Complete the sign Up process
3. Add your Credit/Debit card.

## Contributing

Please send Pull Requests with any information you have on that subject. Next thing I have to append here is the total number of training hours that a aws starter account provides and what to do if you run out of those 30 dollars credit.
